# BPSC240_TE_Example
Scripts for a quick demonstration of LTR identification

This repository is part of Alex Rajewski and Ryan Traband's presentation for BPSC240 at the university of California Riverside. The goal is to provide a quick example of a tool to identify LTR retrotransposons in a genomic fragment and to do some quick and simple analyses of them.

These scripts are intended to be run interactively on the [UCR HPCC](http://hpcc.ucr.edu) and certain commands will not be applicable if you do not have the correct software installed. Computationally, it does not require much in terms of resources.
